# Issue 3: Document updating of the `crypto-scout-client` production ready service to enable modules

The `crypto-scout-client` project has been configured in a container to get the collect crypto data.
So you will need to update professional documentation of the `crypto-scout-client` project that it is ready for
production. I splitted project modules into three parts:

- `bybit.stream.module.enabled`
- `bybit.parser.module.enabled`
- `cmc.parser.module.enabled`

and add possibility to disable modules.
